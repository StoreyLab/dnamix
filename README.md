DNAMIX v. 2 is based on formulas and methods derived in the paper:
Curran JM, Triggs CM, Buckleton J, Weir BS. 1999. Interpreting DNA mixtures in structured populations. Journal of Forensic Sciences, 44: 937-995.

DNAMIX v. 2 is written in FORTRAN 90; if you have a FORTRAN 90 compiler, then you may want to download the source file dnamix2.f and compile it yourself. The executable file is available for Unix and Windows. A user manual is also available.
